## MAGIC Criteria

*Magnitude - overall effect on cognition: cross-sectional studies g = 0.55; intervention studies g = 0.40 (only for young adults)
*Articulation- quite specific in their criteria and hypothesis; very excessively explained, transparent in their choices
*Generality - for younger adults quite general as they used commercially available games; no generality for children/adolescents or older adults
*Interestingness - games are a common part of many people's life -> findings like this build a foundation upon which specific interventions can be build
*Credibility - overall fairly credible; looked at many potential moderators and biases and assessed them
