Video games are an important part of many people’s lives. Mainly in the past, but also in the present, there was and is a lot of public discussion about the (negative) effect of video games, especially “shooter-games”. As these games require a broad repertoire of cognitive skills, like spatial abilities, problem solving or attentional processes. Thus it would make sense if these games play a role in developing higher cognitive skills in many domains. The present meta-analysis aims to measure the impact of action video games on cognition and additionally try to identify potential confounding factors and moderators.

# Overview of the meta-analysis

### Focus of the study
Effect of habitual action video gaming and training with action video games on cognition

### Target group
(Neuro)psychologists & psychiatrists, game-designers and the public

### Average effect sizes
Habitual playing of action video games has a medium effect size on cognition (g = 0.55); intervention with an action video game has a medium effect size on cognition as well (g = 0.40) but only in younger adults

### Additional findings
Accuracy and Speed are equally enhanced (no speed-accuracy trade-off); longer training duration would be helpful in the future; highest impact on the domains of spatial cognition, top-down attention and perception

# Short review

### Introduction
More than 1.2 billion people worldwide are video gamers, with action games as one of the most popular genres. It is important to note that video game genres are very heterogeneous and thus should be researched separately and not as one collective mass. To examine the causal link between playing action video games and cognition one needs to not only compare habitual action video game players (AVGP) to non-players (NVGP) but look at intervention studies with NVGP’s as well.
The authors propose a narrower definition of action video games than previous research and define the following features: a) fast pace, b) high degree of perceptual and motor load, also working memory and goal setting, c) a constant switch between a distributed and highly focused state of attention and d) a high degree of clutter and distraction. In summary these features are commonly found in first- and third-person shooter game from the year 2000 on.

### What are the goals of the study?
The present meta-analysis contains two separate section and analysis: one for the effect of cross-sectional studies and one for the effects of intervention studies on different cognitive domains. Importantly, AVGP’s are defined as people who play action video games at least 3 hours weekly for the last 6 months and NVGP play less than 1 hour of action games and less than 3 hours weekly in general. For intervention studies there had to be an active control group which played a non-action video game like Tetris or The Sims 2. The most prevalent games for the experimental groups were Unreal Tournament 2004, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty 2. 
In addition, the authors controlled for several different moderators, namely the cognitive domain, age group, DV-type (accuracy and speed), effect type (main vs. difference effect), Lab of origin (Bavelier lab vs. other labs) and type of recruitment (overt vs. covert).

### Results of cross-sectional studies
Based on 89 studies and 194 effect sizes, the overall mean weighted effect on cognition was of medium size (g = 0.55, p < .001). Highest effect sizes were observed for the cognitive domains of perception (g = 0.78), spatial cognition (g = 0,75) and top-down attention (g = 0.63), followed by multi-tasking (g = 0.55). Smaller but still significant effect were found for inhibition (g = 0.31) and verbal cognition (g = 0.30). There was no significant impact on the domain of problem-solving. 
Moderator-level analysis showed that there was no difference in the type of cognitive domain, age group, DV-type, effect-type, or recruitment type. Lab of origin was a significant moderator (F = 4.66, p = 0.40) with higher effect sizes observed for the Bavelier lab compared to other labs. 
Importantly, these results are robust for young adults but only a trend could be shown for children (g = 0.32, p = .21).

### Results of interventional studies

The analysis of interventional studies shows a positive effect of action video game play on cognition in young adults (g = 0.40, p < .001) and a negative trend in older adults (g = -.036, p = .16). Therefore, all of the following results focus on young adult intervention studies.

An overall mean weighted size of g = 0.34 across the 5 cognitive domains considered could be found. Interventions using Action Video Games have the highest impact on spatial cognition (g = 0.45, p < .017) and top-down attention (g = 0.31, p < .005), followed by perception (g = 0.23, p = .15). The impact on multitasking (g = 0.29, p = .40) and verbal cognition (g = 0.53, p = .12) was non-significant.

The effect of habitual action video game play is significant in both accuracy (g = 0.35, p = .003) and speed measures (g = 0.54, p = .04). A significant effect of action video game intervention is observed for main effects (g = 0.36, p = .008) but not for difference effects (g = 0.43, p = .165). A significant effect is found for studies carried out by the Bavelier laboratory (g = 1.9, p = .001) but not for studies carried out by other laboratories (g = 0.2, p = .11).

There was no effect of training duration to be found in the multiple moderator analysis (slope = -0.003, p = .73) but a significant effect of training duration was found in the single moderator RVE analysis (slope = 0.015, p = .03). The authors then contrasted the effect of training duration with or without including laboratory of origin in the list of moderators. Without it, there is a weak but visible effect to be observed, which totally disappeared when laboratory of origin was included.

To control for publication bias, the authors of the present meta-analysis conducted contour-ehanced funnel plots (Peters et al., 2008) and Egger's test for asymmetry, which confirmed significant asymmetry (ß = 4.15, p < .001). As a correction for the found asymmetry, the authors conducted a trim-and-fill analysis. Therefore they imputed 7 additional studies with negative effect sizes of low precision. Eventually, the main effect of action video game intervfention still remained sizable and significant (g = 0.40, p < .001). The effect is 32% smaller compared with the Random/Mixed effect (g = 0.58, p < .001). These analyses confirm the overall result of a publication bias threat of about 30%. 

### MAGIC Criteria

<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>agnitude - overall effect on cognition: cross-sectional studies g = 0.55; intervention studies g = 0.40 (only for young adults)</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>rticulation- quite specific in their criteria and hypothesis; very excessively explained, transparent in their choices</li>
<li><strong>G</strong>enerality - for younger adults quite general as they used commercially available games; no generality for children/adolescents or older adults</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nterestingness - games are a common part of many people's life -> findings like this build a foundation upon which specific interventions can be build</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>redibility - overall fairly credible; looked at many potential moderators and biases and assessed them</li>
</ul>

### Implications and Conclusions

The present meta-analysis was able to demonstrate that individuals, who choose to play action video games regularly, exhibit better cognitive skills than those who play little to no video games. The most affected domains are perception, spatial cognition and top-down attention. The analysis of intervention studies suggests a causal role of action gaming in generating these effects.

The impact of action video game play on cognition appeared equally strong for speed and accuracy, which implies that speed-accuracy trade-offs are not a likely result. Another concern of the present meta-analysis was the Expectation/Placebo Hypothesis. However, the presence of medium-to-large effect sizes for both overt and covert recruitment studies aswell as small-to-medium effect sizes for both main effects and difference effects speaks against this hypothesis.

Higher effect sizes have been found in studies carried out by the Bavelier laboratory. It is possible that this derives from the fact that most of the Bavelier studies used a training duration of more than 30 hours while other labs mostly used a training duration of under 30 hours. This implies that it would be useful for other groups to invest in training studies of longer durations for more promising findings.

The authors of the present meta-analysis describe a few reasons on why the effects are different depending on the participants age. Firstly they mentioned, that a game's difficulty could have an impact. Action video games are mostly specifically produced for young adults, which makes it difficult for older adults to perform in the same way. Another issue is the lower compliance in older adults who are asked to train on action games (Boot et al., 2013). It is also important to note that there was a lack of studies with child participants. Nevertheless, there was a positve non-significant trend to be found in children, which acts as a reson to carry out more studies with child participants using nonviolent action video games. 

Some limitations of the present meta-analysis are that many of the moderator effects have rather small degrees of freedom aswell as small sample sizes in most studies. The authors could also show a possibility of publication bias concerns by conducting different analyses.

## Technology consumption and cognitive control: Contrasting action video game experience with media multitasking (Cardoso-Leite et al., 2016)

In this study the authors looked at the interaction of playing action video games and the habit of media multitasking. Media-multitasking describes the concurrent use of two medias like listening to music while reading or texting/browsing the internet while watching a movie.

Participants where divided into light, intermediate or heavy media multitaskers based on their self-perceived use. 
Four cognitive tasks (AX-continous performance task, N-back task, task-switching and filter task) were used in this study to assess differences between AVGP and NVGP depending on their media multitasking group.

Results show that light-media multitaskers perform better in the AX-continous task (with and without distractors) and that AVGP’s performed better only in the intermediate-multitasking group. For the N-back and task-switching tasks AVGP’s again performed better than NVGP’s especially in the intermediate-multitasking group. Lastly, in the filter task heavy-multimedia multitaskers performed worse than both intermediate and light multitaskers and AVGP’s better than NVGP’s in the intermediate-mutitasking group.

Overall, these results show that there is a rather complex relationship between technology use and cognitive control. Habitual action video gamers performed better than non-players in intermediate-multimedia users only and heavy-multimedia multitaskers were for the better part not statistically worse than the other groups. As a limiting factor, sample size was quite small, considering the 2x3 design. Thus, further studies are needed to explore how playing action video games and media multitasking are connected.

## Using video game play to improve education-majors‘ mathematical performance: An experimental study (Novak & Tassell, 2015)

The authors of this study investigated group differences between students with and without considerable action video game experience on cognitive and mathematical skills, mathematics anxiety and confidence. They were also examining the effects of action video game play on education-major students' mathematics performance as mediated by the effect of selective attention on working memory.

For the first experiment, the students were divided into AVGers and non-AVGers and had to carry out several performance tests. The results show significant differences between AVGers and non-AVGers in their Working Memory performance, Geometry performance and in the Mental Rotation performance with AVGers having higher scores respectively. 

For the second experiment, they included only non-AVGers and divided them into two intervention groups - an AVG intervention group that got to play Unreal Tournament 2004 and a non-AVG group which got to play Angry Birds. Both groups got instructed to play their assigned game for 10 hours within 3 weeks. They also got instructed to carry out the same assessment series as in Experiment 1 before and after the video game intervention.

The results show significant improvements in Working Memory performance, Mental Rotation performance and Geometry performance in both groups. There were no significant differences to be found between the groups. These are promising findings as Angry Birds is a casual game that doesn't require special skills or big amounts of time to master these skills. In addition to that, action video games primarily appeal to males only, while non-action casual video games appeal to a considerably broader audience, including both males and females.
