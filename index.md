## Interventional Studies

The analysis of interventional studies shows a positive effect of action video game play on cognition in young adults (g = 0.40, p < .001) and a negative trend in older adults (g = -.036, p = .16). Therefore, all of the following results focus on young adult intervention studies.

An overall mean weighted size of g = 0.34 across the 5 cognitive domains considered could be found. Interventions using Action Video Games have the highest impact on spatial cognition (g = 0.45, p < .017) and top-down attention (g = 0.31, p < .005), followed by perception (g = 0.23, p = .15). The impact on multitasking (g = 0.29, p = .40) and verbal cognition (g = 0.53, p = .12) was non-significant.

The effect of habitual action video game play is significant in both accuracy (g = 0.35, p = .003) and speed measures (g = 0.54, p = .04). A significant effect of action video game intervention is observed for main effects (g = 0.36, p = .008) but not for difference effects (g = 0.43, p = .165). A significant effect is found for studies carried out by the Bavelier laboratory (g = 1.9, p = .001) but not for studies carried out by other laboratories (g = 0.2, p = .11).

There was no effect of training duration to be found in the multiple moderator analysis (slope = -0.003, p = .73) but a significant effect of training duration was found in the single moderator RVE analysis (slope = 0.015, p = .03). The authors then contrasted the effect of training duration with or without including laboratory of origin in the list of moderators. Without it, there is a weak but visible effect to be observed, which totally disappeared when laboratory of origin was included.

To control for publication bias, the authors of the present meta-analysis conducted contour-ehanced funnel plots (Peters et al., 2008) and Egger's test for asymmetry, which confirmed significant asymmetry (ß = 4.15, p < .001). As a correction for the found asymmetry, the authors conducted a trim-and-fill analysis. Therefore they imputed 7 additional studies with negative effect sizes of low precision. Eventually, the main effect of action video game intervfention still remained sizable and significant (g = 0.40, p < .001). The effect is 32% smaller compared with the Random/Mixed effect (g = 0.58, p < .001). These analyses confirm the overall result of a publication bias threat of about 30%. 

# MAGIC Criteria

<ul>
<li>Magnitude - overall effect on cognition: cross-sectional studies g = 0.55; intervention studies g = 0.40 (only for young adults)</li>
<li>Articulation- quite specific in their criteria and hypothesis; very excessively explained, transparent in their choices</li>
<li>Generality - for younger adults quite general as they used commercially available games; no generality for children/adolescents or older adults</li>
<li>Interestingness - games are a common part of many people's life -> findings like this build a foundation upon which specific interventions can be build</li>
<li>Credibility - overall fairly credible; looked at many potential moderators and biases and assessed them</li>
</ul>


# Implications and Conclusions

<p>The present meta-analysis was able to demonstrate that individuals, who choose to play action video games regularly, exhibit better cognitive skills than those who play little to no video games. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The most affected domains are perception, spatial cognition and top-down attention. The analysis of intervention studies suggests a causal role of action gaming in generating these effects.

The impact of action video game play on cognition appeared equally strong for speed and accuracy, which implies that speed-accuracy trade-offs are not a likely result. Another concern of the present meta-analysis was the Expectation/Placebo Hypothesis. However, the presence of medium-to-large effect sizes for both overt and covert recruitment studies aswell as small-to-medium effect sizes for both main effects and difference effects speaks against this hypothesis.

Higher effect sizes have been found in studies carried out by the Bavelier laboratory. It is possible that this derives from the fact that most of the Bavelier studies used a training duration of more than 30 hours while other labs mostly used a training duration of under 30 hours. This implies that it would be useful for other groups to invest in training studies of longer durations for more promising findings.

The authors of the present meta-analysis describe a few reasons on why the effects are different depending on the participants age. Firstly they mentioned, that a game's difficulty could have an impact. Action video games are mostly specifically produced for young adults, which makes it difficult for older adults to perform in the same way. Another issue is the lower compliance in older adults who are asked to train on action games (Boot et al., 2013). It is also important to note that there was a lack of studies with child participants. Nevertheless, there was a positve non-significant trend to be found in children, which acts as a reson to carry out more studies with child participants using nonviolent action video games. 

Some limitations of the present meta-analysis are that many of the moderator effects have rather small degrees of freedom aswell as small sample sizes in most studies. The authors could also show a possibility of publication bias concerns by conducting different analyses.</span></p>
